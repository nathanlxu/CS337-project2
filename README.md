Part of our AllFoods.json (descriptions, cooking methods) and tools.py files take entries from a former project to save time on typing: (https://github.com/tylrodg/CS337-Recipes). Our AllFoods.json also takes inspiration from another project for lists of spices, meats, and vegetables: (https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/tree/master/data/foods), also to save time on typing.
